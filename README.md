# First_milestone Project (GYM)

This is the my first milestone project for code institute for gym website .In this project ,I have displayed the best user experience with their views about the gym services .The website highlights the user views about the services as well.The website contains the responsive scaling behaviour for the best user experience .

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://affan546.github.io/first_milestone/).
 
## UX

## Strategy

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design.

## User Stories

As an employer I expect to see Affan's Show case of work .
As a recruiter I expect to see a showcase of Affan's resume.

## Scope

For new visitors on the website i have added the testimonial section from the current members which will give the new members a better idea of what offers they can get from the super gym and what other current members are getting at the moment .By this way they can gain trust in the gym and will surely try to sign up for the gym membership.

## Structure

In the Welcome to super gym section,I wanted the users to get warm welcome from the gym management and get a quick over view of the gym Services,Afterwards there are some motivation quotations been added just to boost the morale of the members to strive and work hard to get fit .I have done , providing a short summary of the project and main technologies with a link to Github Repository and a live demo .I have tried to make it easy as possible.

## Features

This site uses Bootstrap for smoother functionality and i have tried to make it very smooth for scrolling with scrolling css property.The navbar is also responsive Regardless of the screen size it will remain on the top-right corner and will drop the menus on the bottom with auto-adjustment depending on the platform whether mobile version,tablet or browser view .

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 4.3.1

### Features Left to Implement

In the future, I would like to add further functionalities in this website to make it more user friendly like to display some extra coaching classes like for spinning classes or some nutrition plans as well. I would like to add some videos that display might help users to get some online trainning session for free as well.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
